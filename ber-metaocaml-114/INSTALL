INSTALLATION

*** It is generally best to install MetaOCaml using OPAM ***

You need the source OCaml 4.14.1 distribution, which you can download from
        http://ocaml.org/releases/

1. Download, un-tar the OCaml distribution and configure it as described
   in its INSTALL file

   For example, in the OCaml distribution directory, do

    ./configure -prefix `pwd` --disable-ocamldoc --disable-ocamltest \
    --disable-debugger --disable-debug-runtime --disable-stdlib-manpages \
    --disable-bigarray-lib

  You may chose any other installation prefix. It is best however
  to chose the prefix different from that of the standard OCaml installation,
  so to keep the existing OCaml installation intact (although it should be
  said that MetaOCaml is perfectly compatible with OCaml, at the source
  and binary levels).

1a. Update the Makefile in the ber-metaocaml directory

    change ROOTDIR= at the beginning of the ber-metaocaml/Makefile
    to point to the OCaml distribution directory 

2. Patch the OCaml distribution

   In the ber-metaocaml directory, do

   make patch


3. Compile and install OCaml as usual. For example, in the OCaml 
   distribution directory, do

    make
    make install

4. Build the BER MetaOCaml library, the top-level, and the
   compilation script

   In the ber-metaocaml directory, do

    make all
    make install
    make install.opt

  The BER MetaOCaml top-level can be started afterwards as
    $prefix/bin/metaocaml 

  The batch compiler can be run using metaocamlc (byte-code) or
  metaocamlopt (native)


5. Optionally run sample tests
   
   In the ber-metaocaml directory, do

   make test
   make test-compile
   make test-native


Installation of BER MetaOCaml on Windows has not been tested.
