	Release N101
	Removed environment classifiers.
	Syntax .! is replaced with the ordinary prefix operation
	!.  (alias run) in the module Runcode. Runcode.run is an
	ordinary function, and is not part of the MetaOCaml kernel.
	New API for running code, encouraging the development of new ways
	to execute code values (see metalib/runcode.mli).
	BER N101 is binary compatible with OCaml 4.01. Building it
	no longer involves bootstrapping.
	Printing code is now part of OCaml (Pprintast, which was influenced by
        MetaOCaml).
	Scope-extrusion check works with delimited control.
	Added a test for the well-formedness of recursive let.
	Faster generation of code (especially for functions and nonbinding
	functions).
	More precise tracking of free variables and reporting of scope
	extrusion.

	Re-enabled ocamlbuild.byte target in the Makefile, so to
	to build ocamlbuild as part of the make all.
	A small fix to permit compiling ocamlopt. Although at present,
	ocamlopt can't compile code with brackets, it can compile
	the regular OCaml code. In addition, it supports let!.
	Thanks to Bob Zhang for suggestions.

January 30, 2013
	Rewritten trx.ml. Release N100.

January 12, 2013
	Importing the pretty-printing of code, greatly improved by Jacques

January 7-12, 2013
	Beginning the port to OCaml 4.00.1. The basic changes to OCaml
	are done. Started work on re-writing trx.ml

December 28, 2012
	Version N004 released

November 8, 2012
	Eliminating val_level from value_desc. Introducing Env map stage
	to map an identifier to its stage, if not zero. Several
	OCaml modules no longer have to be patched.
	Simplified CSP code, removed a few patches from typecore.
	SCP now carries strings, native_int, int32, int64 as
	literal constants. Identifiers in List module are carried
	by reference.

October 4, 2012
	Jacques Carette has committed Alain Frisch's patch implementing
	the let! form proposed by Nicolas Pouillard for monadic
	programming in Ocaml.

	See metalib/test/pythagorian_triples.ml for an example.

January 3, 2011
	Added metaocamlmktop

December 2010
	Patch from Fabrice Le Fessant to remove functional values
	from typing Env. See entry May 5, 2010 in Problems.txt.
