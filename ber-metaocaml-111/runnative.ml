 Dynlink library can only load the unit and evaluate its top-level
 expressions. There is no provision for accessing the names defined 
 in the loaded unit. Therefore, the only way to get the result is
 to assign it to a reference cell defined in the main program.
 This file defines "result__" exactly for this purpose.

 Given the code cde, we generate a file

 Runnative.result__ := Some (Obj.repr (cde))

which we then compile and link in.
