(* Another way to run code:
   Converting a simple subset of OCaml to an intermediate language 
   designed to be easily translatable to C, openCL, LLVM, etc.

   We handle only an (imperative) subset of OCaml, as typical in offshoring.

(* Simple OCaml code may be considered as C written in different syntax.
   The following helps bring OCaml closer to C
