2. INSTALLATION

  Please see the file INSTALL


3. STAGING CONSTRUCTS
   (This is a modified version of the section from the last
    release of the original MetaOCaml, Feb 3, 2006)

  The two new expression constructs are

    bracket: .< e >.  to delay computation (to the future stage)
    escape:  .~ e     to perform a computation within brackets
                      and splice-in the result

  A special type constructor, called 'code' builds the type of
  future-stage computations, or code expressions. For example, 

    # .< 2 + 4 >.;;
    - : int code = .<2 + 4>. 

  The type constructor 'code' takes as its argument the type of the
  future-stage expression. Future-stage expressions are executed later,
  but are type-checked now. Therefore, the generated code is assuredly
  well-typed.

  Code fragments can be spliced into larger code contexts by using the
  escape construct: 

    # let x = .< 2 + 4 >. in .< .~ x + .~ x >. ;;
    - : int code = .<(2 + 4) + (2 + 4)>. 

  The escape construct takes an expression of type (t code) and
  produces an expression of type t, but only inside of a
  code-constructing context (i.e., inside inside code brackets).
  Attempting to escape code outside of a code-building context results
  in the following type error:

    # .~ .< 2 + 3 >.;;
    Characters 0-14:
    .~ .< 2 + 3 >.;;
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Wrong level: escape at level 0

  The generated code can be saved to a file, offshored (converted to C,
  for example), or run -- that is, compiled using the byte- or native 
  OCaml compiler and executed, returning the result to the parent program.
  See the modules Runcode and Runnative for running.

    # Runcode.run .< 2 + 3 >.;;
    - : int = 5
    # open Runcode;;
    # run .<fun x y -> x + y >. 2 3;;
    - : int = 5

  The run construct only works on closed code values. Attempting to run
  open code leads to an exception in the generator (which can be traced
  as any other exception).

    # .< fun x -> .~ (let u = run .< x >. in .<()>.) >.;;
    Exception:
    Failure
     "The code built at Characters 7-8:
      .< fun x -> .~ (let u = run .< x >. in .<()>.) >.;;
             ^
     is not closed: identifier x_91 bound at Characters 7-8:
      .< fun x -> .~ (let u = run .< x >. in .<()>.) >.;;
             ^
    is free".

  Please see many more examples in test/trivial.ml and other files
  in the test/ directory.


4. RESTRICTIONS AND COMMON PROBLEMS

   1. All data constructors and record labels used within brackets must
   come from the types that are declared in separately compiled modules.
   For example, the following works:
       .<true>.                 (* data constructor is Stdlib *)
       .<Some [1]>.             (* ditto                         *)
       .<{Complex.re = 1.0; im = 2.0}>. (* The Record Complex is defined *)
                                        (* in the standard library.      *)
       open Complex                     (* which is separately complied  *)
       .<{re = 1.0; im = 2.0}>.

   But the following are not allowed and flagged as compile-time error:

       type foo = Bar
       .<Bar>.

       module Foo = struct exception E end
      .<raise Foo.E>.

   The type declaration foo or the module declaration Foo must be
   moved into a separate file. The corresponding .cmi file must also be
   available at run-time: either placed into the same directory as
   the executable, or somewhere within the OCaml library search
   path.

   2. Escaped expressions at the same level evaluate in the same
   order as arguments in an application. For byte-code OCaml,
   this order is RIGHT to left.

   3. Objects and modules are not supported within brackets
     (but you can use brackets within modules or objects).

   4. Pattern-matching on GADTs within brackets is generally unsound and
      is not permitted

6. CREDITS

  BER MetaOCaml is a complete re-implementation of the original MetaOCaml. 

  The original MetaOCaml was funded primarily by an NSF project titled:

	"ITR/SY(CISE): Putting Multi-Stage Annotations to Work"

  That project was led by Walid Taha. Most of the original development
  and implementation of staging was done by Cristiano
  Calcagno, then at Imperial College. 
  Edward Pizzi has implemented the pretty-printing of code -- which
  since then has been extensively modified and maintained by 
  Jacques Carette.
  Xavier Leroy, INRIA, helped with the compiler specifics.

  Many members of the metaocaml-users and metaocaml-hackers lists have
  helped identify bugs and in some cases fixed them.
