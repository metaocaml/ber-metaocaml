	Release N107

September 22 - October 5, 2018
	Renamed print_code to codelib, which is opened by default.
	The code type is no longer predefined, hence no bootstrapping
	is needed. To make sure it is still printed as `int code'
	rather than `int Trx.code' or `int Codelib.code', we
	make Codelib module opened by default and we set -short-paths
	flag by default.
	Due to changes in OCaml lexer, writing .~.~xxx and
	.~.<xxx>. is no longer allowed. Insert parentheses, as in
	.~(.~xxx) or .~(.<xxx>.).
        Type ascriptions are now accepted (for documentation purposes
	and for type-checking the *meta-program*) but ignored for
	code generation. For `persistent' type ascriptions,
	one should use something like as_int (the identity function
	of a specific type).
	!. is deprecated (still accepted for a while). Use run.
	Improved the scope extrusion error message: now, it also shows
	the code in which the escaped variable has appeared.
	Added lift module for the explicit lifting.
	Added the basic offshoring and a simple illustrative test of
	offshoring to C.

September 19, 2017
	Renamed genlet to genletv; added genlet that produces
	code rather than val_code
	Do let-bind expressions that are values, but expensive values
	such as abstractions (closure creation), constant arrays,
	strings. Albeit values, they allocate memory and are not cheap
	to copy. They should be shared.

April 10, 2017
	Jeremy Yallop: Added a patch that supports writing
	.< e1; e2 >. which previously required parentheses:
	.< (e1; e2) >.

February 7, 2017
	Make 'a closed_code abstract to prevent OCaml from eagerly
	expanding that alias (as reported by Atsushi Igarashi).
	Introducing ast_of_code to get AST.

December 31, 2016
	Release N104

December 30, 2016
	Let-insertion. See genlet.ml and fib.ml in the tests directory
	for the examples.

December 23, 2016
	First-class patterns. See test/pattern.ml for an example of how to
	use this feature.

December 16, 2016
	Native MetaOCaml

December 15, 2016
	Pattern-matching on GADTs within brackets is generally unsound
	(analogous to a lazy pattern-match on GADT).
	(Problem reported by Jeremy Yallop)
	Pattern-matching on GADTs is now prohibited within brackets.

December 14, 2016
	Completed port to OCaml 4.04
	Improved error messages (at least the ones that the metaocaml-specific
	code emits)

August 13, 2015
	Removed the let! feature. Monadic programming is better done
	with syntactic extensions such as those used by Lwt.

June 22, 2015
	Applying a patch by Jeremy Yallop, to correct for the problem
	when a CSP value has the abstract type (that is represented as
	string, for example). In OCaml, the same value may indeed have
	multiple incompatible types. Therefore, we no longer can leave
	strings and doubles to the dyn_quote. If we know the type, we have
	to compile in the appropriate quoter.

December 31, 2014
	Release N102
	- There is no longer a separate Typedtree traversal pass, after
	the type checking, to translate brackets and escapes. The
	translation is done right after the type-checking of the 0-level
	bracket. That means that for staging-annotation-free code,
	MetaOCaml has no substantial overhead.
	- Use attributes for brackets, escapes and CSP (and internally
	for levels and inexpansiveness). Much fewer OCaml files are
	modified.
	- New function Runcode.typecheck_code for the benefit of offshoring
	- New function Runcode.add_search_path to add a directory to
	the search path for .cmi/.cmo files -- report by Nicolas Ojeda Bar
	- Better handling of CSP. For simple cases, there are no longer
	any serialization problems.
	- Overall better printing, of CSP, code and error messages.
	- Overall, more uniform, better-factored code.
	- metaocamlc is now a simple .c file; it adds compiler-libs only
	in the case when the executable is built. Otherwise, we may end up
	with the duplicate libraries.

April 24, 2014
	Fixed the problem noted by Jun Inoue in toplevel MetaOCaml.
	If the first Runcode.run is used after a type declaration,
	the defined type is considered locally scoped, which causes
	type checking errors or assettion faliures in typechecking.
	Preparing the environment for Runcode.run has a side-effect,
	of corrupting Ident timestamps. The timestamps are preserved now.

November 26, 2013
	Release N101
	Removed environment classifiers.
	Syntax .! is replaced with the ordinary prefix operation
	!.  (alias run) in the module Runcode. Runcode.run is an
	ordinary function, and is not part of the MetaOCaml kernel.
	New API for running code, encouraging the development of new ways
	to execute code values (see metalib/runcode.mli).
	BER N101 is binary compatible with OCaml 4.01. Building it
	no longer involves bootstrapping.
	Printing code is now part of OCaml (Pprintast, which was influenced by
        MetaOCaml).
	Scope-extrusion check works with delimited control.
	Added a test for the well-formedness of recursive let.
	Faster generation of code (especially for functions and nonbinding
	functions).
	More precise tracking of free variables and reporting of scope
	extrusion.

February 20, 2013
	Re-enabled ocamlbuild.byte target in the Makefile, so to
	to build ocamlbuild as part of the make all.
	A small fix to permit compiling ocamlopt. Although at present,
	ocamlopt can't compile code with brackets, it can compile
	the regular OCaml code. In addition, it supports let!.
	Thanks to Bob Zhang for suggestions.

January 30, 2013
	Rewritten trx.ml. Release N100.

January 12, 2013
	Importing the pretty-printing of code, greatly improved by Jacques
	Carette.

January 7-12, 2013
	Beginning the port to OCaml 4.00.1. The basic changes to OCaml
	are done. Started work on re-writing trx.ml

December 28, 2012
	Version N004 released

November 8, 2012
	Eliminating val_level from value_desc. Introducing Env map stage
	to map an identifier to its stage, if not zero. Several
	OCaml modules no longer have to be patched.
	Simplified CSP code, removed a few patches from typecore.
	SCP now carries strings, native_int, int32, int64 as
	literal constants. Identifiers in List module are carried
	by reference.

October 4, 2012
	Jacques Carette has committed Alain Frisch's patch implementing
	the let! form proposed by Nicolas Pouillard for monadic
	programming in Ocaml.
	http://pauillac.inria.fr/~protzenk/let-bang.html
	See metalib/test/pythagorian_triples.ml for an example.

January 3, 2011
	Added metaocamlmktop

December 2010
	Patch from Fabrice Le Fessant to remove functional values
	from typing Env. See entry May 5, 2010 in Problems.txt.
	Generic printing is now part of BER MetaOCaml.

March 1, 2010
	Version N002 released, based on OCaml 3.11
